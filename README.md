# samples
Some samples of my projects.

1). PrintScreen

   * Every 15 seconds it's displayed a form to enter a password.
   * If password is incorrect then every 10 seconds the program starts to make screenshots,
   * save to root directory and send to email address.
   * Email address and password are stored in property file.
   *
   * When password is correct the program stops (or not begins) making screenshots. But password form will
   * be displayed every 15 anyway.
   *
   * There are main thread and two daemon threads int the program.
   *
   * Notice:
   * The mail must be allowed to receive massages from undefined programs.

2). equations

   * System equations decision.
